<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

## Project objectives

* Setting up collaboratively environment to work together using GitHub.
* Creating pomâ€™s for different web pages.
* Defining user stories and acceptance criteria.
* Create automated web tests using Selenium framework and behaviour driven testing using Cucumber.


### Technologies used
* Intellji
* Java
* Selenium
* Cucumber
* Gherkin
